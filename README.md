# K-Means-and-Threshold-based-Clustering
## About Repository
With two different findclusters function(findClusters(int numberOfClusters) and findClusters(double threshold)), the dataset can be clustered.

Following techniques were used to implement this tasks:
- K-Means-Clustering
- Threshold-based-Clustering
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- Coefficient of variation calculation

When the clustering algorithms are plotted, the clusters can be seen in different colors on a 2D plane.
